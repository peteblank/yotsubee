If this game gets picked here's a rough roadmap I have outlined so we can get started.

1. be able to change avatars with the dialog.<font size="36">✔</font>
2. be able to buy items from the shopkeeper. 
3. have a very bare boned fighting system. 
4. have a pathfinding cat
5. have an inventory
6. have npcs


That should be good to get us started, the rest can be decided via voting, etc...
Also the godot file sometimes might not pick up the scenes, so you might have to drag and drop them into the godot file.
Ideally I'd like to have a yaml file on the repo so we can use the console. 
Maybe that'll make things easier.
As far as coding, I can use godot, but barely, I'd rather focus on sprites and tiles.
I could have made better assets but we didn't have much time for this game jam.

As far as the code of conduct:


lol just kidding.
